# User Stories - Airbnb Clone Project

This directory contains user stories derived from the use case diagram of the Airbnb Clone backend project.

## Purpose

The goal of these user stories is to translate system interactions into clear, human-centered requirements. They describe the functionality of the system from the perspective of different users, such as guests, hosts, and administrators.

These stories serve as the foundation for feature development, testing, and planning in an Agile workflow.

## File
